A traditional roguelike game developed in python with the libtcod and numpy libraries. Developed alongside the tcod roguelike tutorial (http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/) as an opportunity to learn more about numpy and advanced software architecture in Python.

Eventually, I'd like it to be a game where you play as an academic, drawn down into a series of caves and eventually dungeons by a search for what really happened to the ancient people that went missing there. The end goal is to produce a roguelike game with procedural elements that tell a story, similar to Caves of Qud and Brogue, that remains fresh and moderately unpredictable on subsequent playthroughs.

For now, it's a barebones game on top of a custom engine.

Play it!
